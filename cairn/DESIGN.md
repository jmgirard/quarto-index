# Design

## Purpose & Scope

quarto-index is a Quarto extension for book-quality subject indexing: authors
mark index entries with a format-neutral span syntax, and per-format back-ends
realize the index — LaTeX/PDF first, HTML and others to follow. **The marking
syntax is the product; output formats are back-ends** (a future format request
is in-scope work, not someone else's problem).

Audience: the general Quarto community from day one — documentation, tests,
and edge-case coverage are commitments, not extras (GP1). The capability
roster is **completeness-driven**: the target is a full indexing suite —
cross-references (see/see also), page-range & styling control, multiple named
indexes, sort keys, an HTML back-end, and multi-file book support — not a
minimal personal tool.

Distribution ambition (declared at init 2026-08-16): **tagged public
releases**, with changelog discipline from the start; at first release, submit
to the Quarto extension listing and aim for discoverability. Release timing
stays user-declared. Toolchain profile: generic (see `cairn/PROFILE.md`).

## Contract boundary

- The extension's job ends at correct emitted output for each supported
  format (GP2); mark values are structured, format-neutral data (IP1).
- Quarto version support is part of the contract: a stated minimum version in
  `_extension.yml` and README, eventually CI-tested against the floor and
  latest (candidate: CI matrix).

## Function Families

_None yet — populated as the codebase takes shape._

## Conventions

- Numeric results carry **no oracle-verification commitment** (declared at
  init, 2026-08-16): the universal ≥2-independent-oracle-types bar is waived;
  numeric results, if any arise, are checked ad hoc. Revisit if scoring or
  statistical work enters the project.
- **Collation is best-effort**: non-ASCII terms appearing correctly is an IP2
  commitment, but sort *order* beyond what the user's index processor
  provides is best-effort, aided by the sort-key feature once it lands.

## Design Principles

<!-- IP<n> = Inviolable (hard constraint) block first, then GP<n> = Guiding
     (tradeable with justification); numbers never reused or renumbered —
     retiring one takes a D-entry. Elicited /design-interview 2026-08-16. -->

### Inviolable

- **IP1 — Format-neutral marking.** The index-mark syntax and all attribute
  values carry format-neutral meaning; back-ends realize them per format. A
  mark value is never raw back-end code (no raw LaTeX or HTML pass-through;
  D-001). A feature's *semantics* must be format-neutral even when only one
  back-end realizes it yet; unrealized formats degrade gracefully (IP2).
- **IP2 — Never break the document.** A document using this extension never
  fails to render, and never silently corrupts output, because of a marked
  term: any characters in a visible term appear correctly in the index
  (non-ASCII included), and formats without an index back-end pass the
  visible text through untouched, with no artifacts. An escaping bug, a
  crash on exotic input, or garbage in a back-end-less format is the
  highest-severity bug class and earns a regression test forever.
- **IP3 — Post-release syntax stability.** From the first tagged release
  onward, documented syntax forms change only via a deprecation cycle.
  Before that release the syntax is fluid: pre-release installs are
  at-your-own-risk (stated in the README), with breaks recorded in the
  changelog. The release line is the promise.

### Guiding

- **GP1 — Community-grade, discoverable quality.** Docs, tests, and
  edge-case coverage are commitments user-facing work carries by default;
  README and examples are discovery surface held to extension-listing
  quality.
- **GP2 — The contract ends at correct emitted output.** Per format, the job
  is correct output (e.g., valid `\index{}` LaTeX); whether the user's
  toolchain then builds the index is a documentation surface — known failure
  modes documented, never detected or managed.
- **GP3 — Pure Pandoc-Lua, self-contained.** Zero runtime dependencies
  beyond Quarto; `quarto add` is the entire install story. LaTeX-side needs
  stay within packages bundled in mainstream TeX distributions.
- **GP4 — Zero-config defaults.** The common case works with no
  configuration; options are added compatibly for the uncommon case, never
  required for the common one.
- **GP5 — Minimal API surface.** Prefer one composable mechanism over
  parallel syntaxes; a new syntax form must express something the existing
  mechanism cannot.
- **GP6 — End-to-end verification.** Acceptance evidence for
  output-producing features runs to the final compiled artifact (a PDF with
  a real index), not only intermediate output.

Package choices (e.g., imakeidx) are current idiom, not commitments:
principles bind "the LaTeX back-end," and swapping its implementation is an
ordinary plan-gate choice.

## Architecture

_None yet — describes the system as it **is**, once it exists._

## Known issues

_None._
